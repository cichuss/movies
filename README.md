'Movies' application, which displays a list of my favorite movies.

Requirements, the application should:

- Be implemented using Jetpack Compose
- Display a list of at least 3 movies (Image and title)
- Show details of each movie (on a separate screen) including the main image and description
- The details screen should include a scene breakdown (a grid of images in a 3x3 or 4x4 layout) and a list of actors/creators."
